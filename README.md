# kagicrypto 

Kagi Crypto was created to build a crypto community on the blockchain network based on the universal basic income (UBI) concept.

Free distribution and income for everyone to have their own crypto from any network they want. Of course this encourages new enthusiasm for people who want to start getting into the world of crypto where people can claim free Kagi Crypto using their first wallet.

**How to claim :**
-

- You can send 0 coins to the contract address below according to the available blockchain network you own.

- You will receive your Crypto Kagi automatically and the smart contract will print your Crypto Kagi for you.

- Each wallet can only claim once and will fail if more than that.

- The more people who claim it, the less the Kagi Crypto will print, so you can be the first to own it.
